# Motivational Cognitive Control – ChemControl Models

In order to investigate how the controllability of stressful outcomes affect the recruitment of dopaminergic and serotonergic pathways using computational modeling, we built several Rescorla-Wagner models to fit behavioral data retrieved from a study manipulating controllability.

In total, we've build 4 RW models based on Guitart—Masip et al. 2012, and implemented several models of our own to model a separate controllability estimate.
